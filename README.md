## 👨‍💻 About Me

✨ Senior Software Engineer, Database Whisperer, and Microservices Magician—solving scalability problems one coffee cup at a time. I specialize in making backend systems so robust, they practically run themselves (but let’s not tell the team that).

👨‍🎓 Studied hard (kind of) at BS Anangpuria Institute of Technology and Management, where I mastered the art of cramming and debugging life.

🔨 Built a reputation at BlackRock, Freecharge, and NEEMiiT for turning "impossible" projects into "already done".

## ⚡ What Makes Me "The Guy"

### Experience Highlights:

✨ **Software Engineer @ BlackRock (2023 - Present)**  
Working on the Corporate Action Manager module because hey, someone has to make stock splits and dividends look sexy.  
Automated the management of corporate actions so effortlessly, it’s like Excel sheets became sentient.

✨ **Senior Software Engineer @ Freecharge (2022 - 2023)**  
Built and scaled the CIBIL score feature from scratch—users loved it so much, they thought I was their financial advisor.  
Migrated 20 lakh users’ data to DynamoDB while others debated lunch menus.  
Revolutionized database scalability with master-slave architecture. (Translation: I made sure your app doesn’t crash when you check your credit score.)

✨ **Software Engineer @ NEEMiiT (2021 - 2022)**  
Developed an e-commerce platform so slick, it made FMCG products feel premium.  
Implemented Spring Security because hackers aren’t invited to the shopping spree.

✨ **Founder & Backend Developer @ WeCan.Fit (2019 - 2021)**  
Built a fitness app that’s so good, even couch potatoes got motivated.  
Used ElasticSearch for finding gyms, because "Ctrl+F" isn’t enough for fitness freaks.  
Designed user roles (admin, gym owner, trainer, user), ensuring everyone knows their place.

## 🚀 My Tech Superpowers

**Languages**: Java, SQL (Fluent in both human-readable and machine-readable languages.)
